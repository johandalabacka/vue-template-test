      Which build tool to choose is largely dependent on your experience and needs. Webpack-based setup offers more powerful features such as code splitting, processing static assets as module dependencies and extracting component CSS into a separate file, but can be a bit more complex to configure. Browserify can be easier to setup in scenarios where you donâ€™t need the advanced features that Webpack offers.
